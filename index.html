      <p>Hi! Thanks for reading my application! My name is Matheus "Set" Inacio. I'm a Brazilian developer and I'm <em>really</em> interested in working with you guys.</p>
      <p>This page is my application, my cover letter and my resumé, built specifically for this job opening. <strong>I elaborate thoroughly</strong> on each point, but <strong>you should be able to skim over it</strong> and get the main ideas.</p>

          <h1>A brief story of my life</h1>
          <img class="avatar avatar-float" src="./img/profile.jpg" alt="photo of me">
          <p>I absolutely love creating things and seeing them come to life. It's magical. And there's nothing like the thrill of overcoming a big challenge. You can see why <strong>I love programming.</strong></p>
          <p>I've met this passion of mine since I was a kid,<strong> around 11 years old, </strong>when I started to develop games in RPG Maker - a program for creating jrpgs - learning every single tool in the software. <strong>Although it was visual scripting, everything was there</strong>: if clauses, loops, local and global scopes, objects, and many other things. <strong>The programming logic was the first logic I knew.</strong> This was also when I learned a lot of English on my own, using a physical dictionary, since I didn't have internet connection back then.</p>
          <p>I have strayed from the path for a few years, worked in many other areas, most notably as a high school tutor, and accumulated experience with different things.<strong> When the pandemics hit and left me unemployed, I saw it as an opportunity to get back to programming, my true passion, and so I did.</strong> I have been very dedicated to learn it since then, and now - even though there is always something more to learn - I'm ready to land on a real job, with confidence that I'm going to be able to contribute and be really useful.</p>

          <h1>I <strong><em>love</em></strong> RPG</h1>
          <p>I love games, and the <strong>RPG genre of video games has always been my favorite</strong>, even when I was like 6 years old, playing SNES games on emulators - early Final Fantasies, Super Mario RPG, 7th Saga, Front Mission, Tales of Phantasia, etc.</p>
          <p>Considering I've always loved to create stories, it is no surprise I was enamored when <strong>I discovered tabletop RPG, over 10 years ago.</strong> I still remember my first PC, on my first table, in D&D 5th: a human soldier, Fighter, with Heavy Armor Master as the talent (I've always been good at optimizing things).The rest is history...</p>
          <p>Ever since, I have been playing and GMing on a multitude of systems, from D&D to GURPS, in many genres and scenarios. I have created many worlds and <strong>many</strong> characters, and I'm currently working on a system of my own. It's a d10 dice pool system</p>
          <p>I'm also really proactive with the hobby. <strong>I've introduced dozens of people to tabletop RPG.</strong> I'm always reading about it, discussing in forums, and I'm always learning. <strong>Recently, I have organized an event on my programming school: Trybo RPG.</strong> Many people were interested, and 12 new players met <em>and fell in love</em> with our precious hobby.</p>
          <p>This is the cover I drew, painted and animated for the event:</p>

          <h1>I'm a problem solver</h1>
          <p><strong>I cherish a good challenge.</strong> Truly, I must feel challenged almost every day. I seek them, and I treasure facing them.</p>
          <p>This makes me a good problem solver. I have many tactics for tackling problems, but mostly <strong>I always break them in smaller pieces</strong> - I analyze them, create solutions, then create problems for the solutions, and work iteratively until I come with a solution that will really crack it.</p>
          <p>My early contact with programming <strong>allows me to see the world critically</strong>, and I always try to simplify my solutions to make them as elegant as possible.</p>

          <h1>I'm also a people person</h1>
          <p>I'm really sociable. I truly enjoy talking about things, and I enjoy a good informal ambient. <strong>I work hard, but I also like to chill</strong>, and to play hard.</p>
          <p>Thanks to my previous career as a high school tutor, <strong>I'm communicative, and I'm always open to give and receive feedback.</strong> I can be perfeccionist at times, but I'm working on that.</p>

          <p>I know everyone says that, but I do have a true knack for it.</p>
          <p>I have also <strong>extensively studied the art of learning</strong>, also thanks to my previous career as a tutor, and wrote a brief scientific article on a method of revision.</p>

          <p>Things don't often pique my interest, <em>but when they do</em>, <strong>I go all in.</strong></p>
          <p>It's hard to put this characteristic in words, but I'll give an example: after Angel Piscola told me on an email that I need to know about backend scaling, I've messaged the CTO of the programming school I'm in for directions on the topic, and I have been studying it.</p>

          <h1>Bonus skills</h1>
          <p>I've talked about my main skills, besides the required React, TypeScript and Node, but I believe some other things may come in handy:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><em>I can design.</em> Although it's not my primary skill, I'm not clueless with design, and I understand most of the principes, such as information hierarchy and white space. I know how to use the tools, Adobe Suite, Figma, among others..</li>
            <li><em>I can write.</em> Even though English is not my first language and sometimes it isn't perfect, I know how to write well, since I have taught essay writing in the past.</li>
            <li><em>I can illustrate.</em> I'm not a professional artist, but on a pinch, I can supply the need. <a target="_blank" href="https://ibb.co/album/BLzYF0">Here are some pictures</a> of concept arts I created for a game I'm developing on Scratch.</li>

          <h1>Example project: ColorQuest</h1>
          <p>I've been working hard for the last couple weeks on this project especially to have an example of my React skills for the job, since I don't have the 3+ years experience listed on the posting.</p>
          <p>Here's the link: <a target="_blank" href="https://colorquest.me.">https://colorquest.me</a>. It's a color picking game made with Next+React+TypeScript.</p>
          <p>You can find the repository <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/heyset/colorquest">here</a>. For now, there is no documentation, since I've finished the project today. I'm working on documentation and <a href="https://github.com/heyset/colorquest/issues">other issues</a> I have listed of the repo.</p>
          <p>I have used functional components to practice hooks, and experimented with changing CSS variables from within the Contexts.</p>
