        <h1>A brief story of my life</h1>
        <p>I absolutely love creating things and seeing them come to life. It's magical. And there's nothing like the thrill of overcoming a big challenge. You can see why <strong>I love programming.</strong></p>
        <p>I've met this passion of mine since I was a kid,<strong> around 11 years old, </strong>when I started to develop games in RPG Maker - a program for creating jrpgs - learning every single tool in the software. <strong>Although it was visual scripting, everything was there</strong>: if clauses, loops, local and global scopes, objects, and many other things. <strong>The programming logic was the first logic I knew.</strong> This was also when I learned a lot of English on my own, using a physical dictionary, since I didn't have internet connection back then.</p>
        <p>I have strayed from the path for a few years, worked in many other areas, most notably as a high school tutor, and accumulated experience with different things.<strong> When the pandemics hit and left me unemployed, I saw it as an opportunity to get back to programming, my true passion, and so I did.</strong> I have been very dedicated to learn it since then, and now - even though there is always something more to learn - I'm ready to land on a real job, with confidence that I'm going to be able to contribute and be really useful.</p>

        <h1>I love RPG</h1>
        <p>I love games, and the <strong>RPG genre of video games has always been my favorite</strong>, even when I was like 6 years old, playing SNES games on emulators - early Final Fantasies, Super Mario RPG, 7th Saga, Front Mission, Tales of Phantasia, etc.</p>
        <p>Considering I've always loved to create stories, it is no surprise I was enamored when <strong>I discovered tabletop RPG, over 10 years ago.</strong> I still remember my first PC, on my first table, in D&D 5th: a human soldier, Fighter, with Heavy Armor Master as the talent (I've always been good at optimizing things).The rest is history...</p>
        <p>Ever since, I have been playing and GMing on a multitude of systems, from D&D to GURPS, in many genres and scenarios. I have created many worlds and <strong>many</strong> characters, and I'm currently working on a system of my own. It's a d10 dice pool systmem with a variable success degree.</p>
        <p>I'm also really proactive with the hobby. <strong>I've introduced dozens of people to tabletop RPG.</strong> I'm always reading about it, discussing in forums, and I'm always learning. <strong>Recently, I have organized an event on my programming school: Trybo RPG.</strong> Many people were interested, and 12 new players met <em>and fell in love</em> with our precious hobby. Below is the video which was the cover I drew and animated for the event:</p>

        <h1>I'm a problem solver</h1>
        <p><strong>I cherish a good challenge.</strong> Truly, I must feel challenged almost every day. I seek them, and I treasure facing them.</p>
        <p>This makes me a good problem solver. I have many tactics for tackling problems, but mostly <strong>I always break them in smaller pieces</strong> - I analyze it, create solutions, then create problems for the solutions, and work iteratively until I come with a solution that will really crack it.</p>
        <p>My early contact with programming <strong>allows me to see the world critically</strong>, and I always try to simplify my solutions to make them as elegant as possible.</p>
